We would always welcome any feedback to help the project improve.

# Email

Email is a simple means to contact me informally:
[Simon Bond](mailto:simon.bond7@nhs.net)

# GitHub

Once the project nears completion, it would be more systematic for users to formally use the [github repository](https://github.com/shug0131/eudraCT) to [log issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).  Ideally you would be able to provide examples that create a problem, which can then be translated into tests and be dealt with.
