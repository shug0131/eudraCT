We would always welcome any feedback to help the project improve.


# GitHub

Users can  [log issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), at either the
[overall repository](https://github.com/shug0131/eudraCT) for general or SAS/Stata issues,  or the [R package repository](https://github.com/shug0131/eudract_pkg) for ones specific to R.  Ideally you would be able to provide examples that create a problem, which can then be translated into tests and be dealt with.

# Email

Email is a simple means to contact me informally:
